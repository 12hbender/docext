For the image functionality: use pulldown_cmark since that's what rustdoc uses,
use env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR") and file!(), the included files should be relative to the
source file. This makes sense: since the documentation is right there with the code,
so should be the related doc files like images. The images should not all be in the
root dir, this doesn't make sense.

Whenever cmark gives an image event, change the source string (cmark gives out the range
in the original string, which makes this possible) to point to the base64 URL of the local
file. You can use std::fs for file I/O. You also have to check if the image is a URL or a local
file, you can use the url library for this.
